## NEW REPO FOR Wavin AHC 9000
There will be no more updates to the Wavin Components in this Repo.
Please take a look at the new v3 version in this repo: https://github.com/heinekmadsen/esphome_wavinahc9000v3

## ESPHome custom components

My creation of custom components fro ESP home.

### Recent updates
05-07-2025 - Updated for ESPHome 2025.6.5+ Compatibility
A big thanks to ricobach for the PR on this.

23-10-2023 - BREAKING CHANGE!!!
Added the ability to use substitutions for channel offset/alignment

The following lines needs to be added to yaml.
```yaml
  # CHANNEL Alignments (ONLY change if you have offsets in channel vs temperature. Some have reported this if using multiple strings pr. room thermostat)
  channel_01_sensor: "0x00"
  channel_02_sensor: "0x01"
  channel_03_sensor: "0x02"
  channel_04_sensor: "0x03"
  channel_05_sensor: "0x04"
  channel_06_sensor: "0x05"
  channel_07_sensor: "0x06"
  channel_08_sensor: "0x07"
  channel_09_sensor: "0x08"
  channel_10_sensor: "0x09"
  channel_11_sensor: "0x0A"
  channel_12_sensor: "0x0B"
  channel_13_sensor: "0x0C"
  channel_14_sensor: "0x0D"
  channel_15_sensor: "0x0E"
  channel_16_sensor: "0x0F"

  channel_01: "0x00"
  channel_02: "0x01"
  channel_03: "0x02"
  channel_04: "0x03"
  channel_05: "0x04"
  channel_06: "0x05"
  channel_07: "0x06"
  channel_08: "0x07"
  channel_09: "0x08"
  channel_10: "0x09"
  channel_11: "0x0A"
  channel_12: "0x0B"
  channel_13: "0x0C"
  channel_14: "0x0D"
  channel_15: "0x0E"
  channel_16: "0x0F"
```
  
04-07-2022 - Wavin v2 has issues with ESPhome 2022.6. It fails writing a number back to the Wavin device. Added yaml to basic.yaml to ensure it uses the modbus and modbus_controller component from ESPhome 2022.5.1. Please to a clean and update your ESPhome device to make it work with ESPhome 2022.6.

23-03-2022 - Wavin Sentio - Added support for Wavin Sentio. nic6911 https://github.com/nic6911 have worked hard on a Wavin Sentio component and it has now beed added to this repo.
23-03-2022 - WavinAhc9000v2 - BREAKING CHANGE!!! Add the basic.yaml to the list of packages, see example below. Added support for comfort temperature (seperate climate entity). Added mode action to reflect the current output state of the channel. Idle = not heating, Heat = Heating
23-03-2022 - Genvexv2 - Changed current temp from T1 to T7 as T1 drops when bypass is open. Changed climate entity to .1 decimals.

21-03-2022 - WavinAhc9000v2 - A big thanks to nic6911 https://github.com/nic6911 for testing the comfort temperature config file and providing config files for confort for all the channels

18-03-2022 - WavinAhc9000v2 - Added a file for comfort temperature for channel 1. Only for testing. HAVENT TESTED MY SELF AS I DONT HAVE A THERMOSTAT WITH IR. Please report back if working or not.

16-03-2022 - WavinAhc9000v2 - Inspired by Jopand's work on the nilan custom component I have created an updated version for Wavin Ahc 9000, utilizing the esphome modbus_controller and alot of esphome lambda (Thank you for not using standard modbus function Wavin!).

02-03-2022 - Genvexv2 - Inspired by Jopand's work on the nilan custom component I have created an updated version for Genvex, utilizing the esphome modbus_controller.

### Installation

## V2 - Genvex
```yaml

    ref: main
    files: [components/genvexv2/optima250.yaml]

## V2 - Wavin
~~To use the Wavin V2 you need to be running the ESPHome dev version in Home Assistant (https://esphome.io/guides/faq.html#how-do-i-use-the-latest-bleeding-edge-version)~~
To make it easy to name the entities we make use of substitutions in ESPHome. Add this at the top of your yaml file and edit to your needs:
```yaml
substitutions:
  # UNIQUE NAME FOR THE DEVICE
  device: wavin # Case sensitive!!!
  name: Wavin   # "Friendly name" - not case sensitive!!!
  
  # CHANNEL friendly names (If using spaces remember to add ")

## Tips an Tricks
Depending on the hw you use, you may need to add "flow_control_pin: xx" to your yaml under modbus. Replace xx with the GPIO you use for flow control.





## Legacy
Follow the instructions below for the old genvex and wavin components
Add this repository to your ESPHome config yaml:
